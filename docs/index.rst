Welcome to govlab-static-tools's documentation!
===============================================

govlab-static-tools (or simply govlabstatic) is a collection of tools
that make it slightly easier to build static websites for 
GovLab_.

GovLab static sites make use of staticjinja_ and Jinja2_ for the
generation of HTML content and SASS_ for CSS.

Philosophy
----------

This package is generally intended to be used as glue that exposes
the functionality of existing third-party libraries for core
functionality when possible. It's also intended to provide
testing tools out-of-the-box.

Examples
--------

For examples of this package in use, see the
`example project`_ and the source for the `GovLab website`_.
