Welcome to govlab-static-tools's documentation!
===============================================

govlab-static-tools (or simply govlabstatic) is a collection of tools
that make it slightly easier to build static websites for 
GovLab_.

GovLab static sites make use of staticjinja_ and Jinja2_ for the
generation of HTML content and SASS_ for CSS.

Documentation for this package still needs to be written, but
for now interested individuals may want to investigate the
example_ and the source for the `GovLab website`_.
